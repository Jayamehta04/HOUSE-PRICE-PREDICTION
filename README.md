This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting house prices based on key features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other influential factors. The model uses advanced regression techniques to provide accurate price estimates, making it useful for real estate professionals, investors, and anyone interested in property valuation.

Features:
Predict House Prices: Uses features like location, area, number of rooms, and more to predict house prices.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data, categorical encoding, and normalization for accurate predictions.
Machine Learning Models: Implements regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees) for price prediction.
Evaluation Metrics: Includes performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess model accuracy.

Dataset:
The dataset contains real estate listings with the following key features:

Location: Geographic area or neighborhood.
Size (sq ft): Total area of the house.
Number of rooms: Bedrooms and bathrooms.
Make sure your dataset is formatted similarly to ensure compatibility with the model.

Model
The project implements regression models for price prediction, including:

Linear Regression: A basic model for estimating the price.
Decision Tree Regression: A tree-based model for capturing non-linear relationships.
Feel free to experiment with other regression models or fine-tune hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
